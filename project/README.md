## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end development and deployment of a scalable, event-driven machine learning application on AWS.
Built entirely with AWS SageMaker, Lambda, and Step Functions, it delivers a binary image classification system that distinguishes between bicycles and motorcycles using modern MLOps practices and serverless architecture.
The project was developed as part of the AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree Program on Udacity.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

🏗️ Build

Develop and deploy a production-ready deep learning model on Amazon SageMaker, applying best practices in tuning, versioning, and reproducibility.

🔗 Integrate

Connect the model with AWS Lambda functions for data preprocessing, inference, and automation within a serverless architecture.

🔄 Orchestrate

Automate the end-to-end ML workflow using AWS Step Functions, enabling scalable, event-driven model operations.

🚀 Deploy & Monitor

Implement serverless inference with Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor for continuous performance tracking, data drift detection, and lifecycle management.

## 💼 Business Problem

**Scones Unlimited** needs to optimize their delivery operations by automatically routing delivery professionals based on their vehicle type:
- **Bicyclists** → Assigned to nearby orders
- **Motorcyclists** → Assigned to distant orders


### 🚧 Challenge

Manual vehicle verification is a time-consuming and error-prone process.
By automating image classification, this project aims to streamline vehicle identification and support their team on broader applications such as:

 - Detecting bicycles and motorcycles in roadway imagery or surveillance feeds

 - Enhancing traffic monitoring and reporting workflows

 - Supporting automated quality checks and visual inspections in real-world operations

This challenge demonstrates how computer vision and AWS-based automation can reduce human effort, improve data-driven decision-making
